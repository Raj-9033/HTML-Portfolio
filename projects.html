    <h1>Project Details</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>I. Personal Portfolio Website</h2>

    <p>a). I designed and developed my personal portfolio website using the following technologies:</p>
    <div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.kij1QlZKaZtCPtEbWQpiVAAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" /></div>
    <p>b). This website includes the section of projects, about, contact, etc. Thus highlighting my creative and
        technical skills.</p>
    <p>c). The tool used for building this website was visual studio code with few extensions.</p>
    <p>d). There is also a section to download resume, visit github, and visit linkedin</p>

    <h2>II. Credit Card Fraud Detection</h2>

    <p>a). The project was based on Machine learning, where the objective is
        to find anomalies in the system for organizations that have a great
        exchange of transactions with the utilization of cards. </p>
    <p>b). Used kaggle for datasets and implemented a number of libraries
        likes numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc in python. </p>
    <p>c). Based on decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM)
        algorithms. And jupyter notebook tool for writing code. </p>
    <p>d). Technology includes:</p>

    <h2>III. Anti-theft Security System</h2>

    <p>a). The project was based on Internet of Things(IOT), and python programming language.</p>
    <p>b). It aims to protect the users' valuables by achieving security measures. It includes certain hardwares Arduino
        Uno, ESP8266 Modules, breadboard, etc. </p>
    <p>c). Software includes IFTTT for sms services, Blynk App for dashboard and maintenance.</p>
    <p>d). Hardware and software includes:</p>
